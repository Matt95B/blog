This guide outlines the step-by-step process for enrolling your organisation in Apple Business Manager (ABM). Apple Business Manager centralises device deployment, app distribution, and identity management, making it an essential component of any Apple device strategy in the enterprise.

## Pre-Requisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Organisation information** including legal entity name, phone number, and a valid **D-U-N-S number**. This number is issued by Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) and verifies your business identity.
- **A business-associated email address** to create the initial ABM Administrator account.  
  _Consumer email domains (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) are not supported._
- **A verification contact** who can confirm your role and is authorised to bind your organisation to the ABM Terms and Conditions (typically a CIO, IT Director, or Procurement lead).

## Registration Steps

1. **Navigate to the enrollment portal**
   - Business: [business.apple.com](https://business.apple.com) → **Enroll now**
   - Education: [school.apple.com](https://school.apple.com)

2. **Provide Organisation Information**
   - Enter the organisation name, phone number, and D-U-N-S number.
   - If needed, look up your D-U-N-S number:  
     https://express.illion.com.au/

3. **Provide Your Details**
   - Enter your full name, business email address, and role.
   - The email you provide must not already be associated with an Apple ID.
   - **Recommendation:** Use a generic/corporate mailbox for the initial Administrator (e.g. `Apple.ABM@yourdomain.com`). This can be a shared mailbox or distribution group.

4. **Provide Verification Contact**
   - Enter their name, role, and business email address.
   - This contact must be authorised to accept ABM terms on behalf of your organisation.  
     Apple may call this person to verify the request.

5. **Submit the Application**
   - Review the details and click **Continue** to submit the enrollment.

## Enable Two-Step Verification
Before Apple can complete your enrollment, you must verify your email and enable two-step verification on your new Apple ID via:  

https://appleid.apple.com

Follow the instructions provided on the website.

You will receive a **Recovery Key** — store this securely, as it is required to recover your account if needed.

**Best Practice:** Add **at least two trusted phone numbers** to avoid lockout in case you lose access to a device.

## Wait for Approval
Apple typically processes enrollments within **around one week**. You will receive an email once:

- Your organisation details have been validated, and
- Your verification contact has approved the request.

After approval, you will be assigned an **Organisation ID**, visible in:

**Settings → Enrollment Information**

If you purchase Apple devices from an authorised reseller or carrier, provide them with this ID so your new devices appear in ABM for Automated Device Enrolment.

## Add Administrators
To add additional administrators:

1. Log in to the ABM portal.
2. Navigate to **Accounts → Add New Account**.
3. Enter the user’s name, Managed Apple ID, email, role, and location.

There is no limit to the number of administrator accounts you can create.

## Add Resellers
To enable Automated Device Enrolment:

1. Go to **Settings → Device Management Settings**.
2. Add your:
   - **Apple Customer Number**
   - **DEP Reseller ID**
   - or both, depending on how your organisation purchases devices.

This ensures all eligible devices purchased from Apple or authorised resellers are automatically assigned to your ABM account.
