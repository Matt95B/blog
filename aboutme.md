title: About me
---

My name is Mathieu Beaugrand, and I am a Senior Solution Engineer at Omnissa.

With over 17 years of experience as an IT consultant, I specialise in Modern Workplace and End User Computing (EUC) technologies. Passionate about technology and driven by innovation, I thrive on helping organisations achieve their goals by crafting efficient, user-centric solutions.

As a lifelong learner, I continually explore emerging technologies to stay ahead of industry trends. My expertise includes identifying and scoping EUC requirements for customers, with a strong focus on Unified Endpoint Management (UEM), endpoint security, and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). I also enjoy optimising endpoint deployment processes to enhance business efficiency and deliver a seamless user experience.

What truly motivates me is collaborating with clients to design and implement practical, user-friendly EUC solutions that make a meaningful impact on their daily operations. Seeing these solutions improve productivity and simplify how people work is what makes this field so rewarding.
